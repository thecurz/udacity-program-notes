# Udacity Templates and Notes

This repository is a personal library of templates and notes gathered from Udacity Nanodegree programs. I use it as a quick starting point for assignments, projects, and write-ups.

## What's here
- Templates for project planning, reports, and submissions.
- Notes and checklists pulled from course materials.
- Helpful snippets I find worth reusing.

## How I use it
- Copy a template into the relevant project folder.
- Tweak it to match the specific project requirements.
- Keep the original template intact here for reference.

## Update note
These templates are living documents. I will update them as Udacity materials change or as I refine my own workflow.

## License
Personal use only.
